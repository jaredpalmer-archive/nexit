# NEXiT.js 

Like brexit, but for Next.js...

I love Next.js, but I don't care for the filesystem-as-the-router approach. So I
built this. It mashes up the data fetching of Next with your good old friend 
react-router v3. Everything else is just boilerplate...for now. 

- You can tryout some stuff like react-dom-stream or rapscallion
- You can totally move to Preact or Inferno
